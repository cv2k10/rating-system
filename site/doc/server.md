Let’s systematically dive deeper into each main file and directory, describing their likely roles and key points based on your project structure and requirements.

1. db/
Purpose:
Stores database-related files, such as the actual database (likely SQLite), migration scripts, or seed data.

Importance:

Central for storing invoice, customer, service, and rating data.
Secure storage is essential for token validation and preventing unauthorized access.
2. netlify/
Purpose:
Contains deployment configuration for Netlify.

Key File:

May contain a _redirects file to handle SPA routing, ensuring all routes serve index.html (as per your memory).
Importance:

Ensures smooth deployment and proper routing for client-side navigation.
3. node_modules/
Purpose:
Standard directory for all Node.js dependencies.

Importance:

Not edited directly, but critical for running the backend and possibly frontend build tools.
4. package.json & package-lock.json
Purpose:

package.json lists project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
package-lock.json locks dependency versions for reproducible installs.
Importance:

Defines the tech stack (Express, EJS, crypto libraries, etc.).
Scripts for starting the server, running tests, or building assets.
5. requirements.md
Purpose:
Project requirements and overview.

Key Points from Your File:

Two main pages: Admin (for generating secure rating links) and Rating (for customers to submit ratings).
Security: Cryptographically secure tokens, validation of URLs, and prevention of URL manipulation.
Admin features: Form inputs for invoice/customer/service, generation of secure links.
Rating page: Validates parameters, displays invoice info, accepts ratings.
Importance:

Guides the architecture and security model of the application.
6. server.js
Purpose:
The main backend server file.

Expected Contents:

Express app setup.
API endpoints for generating links, validating tokens, and receiving ratings.
Middleware for security (token generation/validation).
Database connection logic.
Rendering EJS views for admin and rating pages.
Importance:

Core logic for business rules, security, and data flow.
7. views/
Purpose:
Contains EJS templates for rendering HTML pages.

Expected Structure:

admin/ subdirectory: Admin interface for generating links.
rating/ or similar: Customer-facing rating submission form.
Shared partials/layouts for consistent look and feel.
Importance:

Defines the user interface for both admins and customers.
Dynamic rendering based on server-passed data (invoice info, validation status, etc.).
Next Steps
Would you like me to:

Start with a deep-dive into server.js to summarize its endpoints and logic?
Or look into the views/ folder to describe the structure and contents of your EJS templates?
Or analyze the database structure in db/?
Let me know your preferred order, or I can proceed sequentially starting with server.js.

Start with a deep-dive into server.js to summarize its endpoints and logic

Analyzed

server.js
Here’s a deep-dive summary of your server.js, focusing on its endpoints, logic, and key architectural points:

High-Level Structure
Frameworks & Libraries: Uses Express.js for the web server, SQLite for the database, EJS for templating, crypto for security, dotenv for environment variables.
Database: SQLite database with tables for invoices, ratings, rating questions, services, providers, and customers. Database schema initialized from a SQL file.
Security: Generates cryptographically secure tokens for rating links using HMAC-SHA256.
Key Components & Logic
1. Initialization & Middleware
Database Setup:
Ensures the db/ directory exists.
Loads schema from db/schema.sql and initializes tables on server start.
Enables SQLite foreign key constraints.
Express Middleware:
Parses JSON and URL-encoded bodies.
Serves static files from the public directory.
Uses EJS templating with layouts.
Debug middleware logs each request.
Admin Path:
Generates a random admin path (or uses value from .env).
All admin routes are namespaced under this path for security.
2. Helper Functions
generateToken(invoiceNumber):
Creates a secure token for a given invoice using a secret key.
getFormattedInvoiceNumber / getAndIncrementInvoiceNumber:
Handles invoice numbering, supporting both manual and automatic modes.
3. Main Endpoints
General
GET /
Renders the public landing page (index.ejs).
Admin Routes (all under /[ADMIN_PATH]):
GET /
Renders the admin dashboard for generating rating links.
Loads lists of customers, services, providers, and invoice config from the database.
GET /config
Loads configuration page with rating questions, services, providers, and customers.
GET /dashboard
Loads dashboard with statistics, filters, and rating breakdowns using complex SQL queries.
API Endpoints (admin):
POST /api/generate-link
Accepts invoice details, generates a secure rating link with a token, and stores it in the database.
POST /api/rating-questions
Adds a new rating question.
PUT /api/rating-questions/:id
Updates a rating question.
DELETE /api/rating-questions/:id
Deletes a rating question.
POST /api/rating-questions/reorder
Reorders rating questions.
Customer-Facing
GET /rate (not shown in outline, but likely exists)
Validates the invoice number and token from the URL.
If valid, displays the rating form with invoice details.
If invalid/expired, blocks access.
POST /rate
Accepts customer ratings, validates input, and saves responses to the database.
Security & Validation
Token Validation:
Each rating link includes a secure token tied to the invoice number.
Prevents URL guessing/manipulation.
Database Transactions:
Uses transactions for multi-step updates (e.g., submitting ratings, reordering questions).
Summary Table
| Area | Purpose/Role |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialization | Sets up Express, EJS, SQLite, and loads schema |
| Admin Path | Obscures admin routes for security |
| Helper Functions | Token generation, invoice number handling |
| Admin Endpoints | Dashboard, config, statistics, question management |
| Customer Endpoints| Rating form display and submission, token validation |
| Security | HMAC tokens, database transactions, input validation |
